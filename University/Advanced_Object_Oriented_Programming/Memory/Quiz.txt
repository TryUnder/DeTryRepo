Quiz:

1.Is memory allocation on the stack faster than on the heap?

Memory allocation on the stack is much faster than on the heap mostly due to the lower number of
opearation that need to be done by processor in order to allocate such memory.

2.Where can we allocate objects?
    * stack
    * heap

3.What is the return value optimization? (RVO)

Return value optimization is the compiler technique to eliminate unnecessary use of copy or move
operations when returning objects from functions. 
Unlike creating a temporary object that holds a value, compiler tries to construct the return value
object at its final destination instead.
This technique is available by the use of copy-constructor or/and move-constructor.
