Quiz:

1) What are the reference types, and what are their hallmarks?

    * l-value reference (T&) - Binds to data that we can modify, but not move.
    * const l-value reference (const T&) - Binds to data that we neither can modify nor move.
    Can be bined not only to l-value but to an rvalue too. 
    * r-value reference (T&&) - Bind to data that we can both modify and move (because
    they soon will not be needed). Can be bind to an rvalue, but not to an lvalue.
    * const r-value reference (const T&&)

2) What can we initialize a const reference with?
    * Const reference can be initialized with l-value or r-value.

3) Can we get an rvalue reference to a non-const lvalue?
    * The answer shouldn't be affirmative, because lvalue reference cannot be bind
      to an rvalue.
